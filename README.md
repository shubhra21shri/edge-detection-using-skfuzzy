# edge-detection-using-skfuzzy
Fuzzification: The fuzz.trimf() function creates triangular membership functions for low, medium, and high intensity values of pixels. Fuzzy Rules: We combine the fuzzy sets of low, medium, and high intensities to detect edges. Defuzzification: The result is defuzzified into a binary image using a threshold value.
